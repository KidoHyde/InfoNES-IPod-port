# InfoNES-IPod-port
A port of RockBox's InfoNES plugin with updates to support the IPod4 and up

Not quite sure how to set this up so I'll put the InfoNES folder from rockbox/apps/plugins here


Controlls:

- Hold button(Top piece): Menu <br/>
- Select(Middle button): A <br/>
- Menu: Up <br/>
- Play: Down <br/>
- Left: Left <br/>
- Right: Right <br/>
- Play & Select: Start <br/>
- Left & Select: Select <br/>

#### **Note:** Atm B button has no working bind, will try to update soon
